<h1>Chatting Application on the break-room.ch website</h1>

To take a closer Look at the whole breake-room project refer to my other repository [https://github.com/HelloAlex4/Brake-RoomApp]

this Repository primarily focuses on the anonymous Chatting application inside the project mentioned before

<h2>Chat App</h2>
This Application uses a SQL server for storing the messages and other information about the user such as their IP-adress to ensure a safe and friendly envoirement

For the Frontend im using a simple html css and js application. The javascript fetches the last 100 sent messages from the server every 2 seconds and then displays them on the page

On the Backend I'm using a simple PHP script to log the messages and filter messages that shouln't be displayed.
